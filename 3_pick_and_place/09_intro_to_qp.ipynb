We usually denote the optimal solution by $x^*$. Most of the times, the constraints are hard-constraints, meaning that they must be fulfilled by the optimal solution. \n\nDrake offers a very good interface to many solvers using `MathematicalProgram`. Let's try to solve a simple problem using `MathematicalProgram`: \n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\min_x \\quad & \\frac{1}{2}x^2 \\\\ \\textrm{s.t.} \\quad & x\\geq 3 \\end{aligned}$$\n\nBefore we start coding, what do you expect the answer to be? You should persuade yourself that the optimal solution is $x^*=3$, since that is value at which minimum cost is achieved without violating the constraint.\n\n","block_group":"7c730f3a9c4b499cb8bd91fccfbec837"},{"cellId":"b3b48259c3cd45239759c84b825c5c43","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Khi7GeVNcwtU","colab":{},"colab_type":"code","cell_id":"b3b48259c3cd45239759c84b825c5c43","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"\"\"\"\nSteps to solve a optimization problem using Drake's MathematicalProgram\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1.

Note that the cost is a quadratic function of the decision variables, while the constraints are all linear. This is what defines a convex QP. \n\nLet's practice solving a simple QP: \n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\min_{x_0,x_1,x_2} \\quad & x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 \\\\ \\textrm{s.t.} \\quad & \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 & 1 \\\\ 5 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\\\  \\quad &  \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\leq \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix} \\end{aligned}$$\n\nTo conveniently write down constraints that are vector-valued, Drake offers `eq,le,ge` for elementwise constraints. It might take some time to learn the syntax of constraints.
